    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chocolate chocolate chip cookies are made with cocoa powder and chocolate chips to guarantee chocolaty
        flavor in every bite. My kids love them!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Butter: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
        </li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure. </li>
        <li>Cocoa powder: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty. </li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>Walnuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
    </ul>
